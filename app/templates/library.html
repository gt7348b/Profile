<h2>Transportation Planning Library</h2>

<p>This represents a cross section of various planning studies that are not
  generally found online. It is not meant to be a comprehensive focus, but
  does present public materials with a focus on transit planning efforts
  in Atlanta, Georgia. It also includes the work products of the
  Transit Planning Board - a joint effort of the Atlanta Regional Commission,
  Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, and the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid
  Transit Authority from 2006 - 2008.</p>
